OpenGEODE
=========

OpenGEODE is an open-source SDL editor that is developed for
the purpose of providing an easy to use and free state machine editor and
Ada code generator to the TASTE toolchain from the European Space Agency,
running in combination with ESA's "Space Certifiable" ASN.1 compiler.

SDL is the Specification and Description Language (Z100 standard from ITU-T).

This is NOT related to the graphical Simple DirectMedia Layer libraries!

Visit http://sdl-forum.org for more information about SDL.

Features
--------

- Graphical editor of SDL processes and procedures.
- Support for state composition and state aggregation (parallel/nested states)
- Works on pure PR+CIF files (textual SDL notation)
- Supports ASN.1 data types using ESA Space Certified compiler (www.github.com/ttsiodras/asn1scc)
- Generates Ada code
- Automatic conversion to Statechart diagrams
- Save the complete or parts of the model to PNG/SVG/PDF files
- Hyperlinks (link a symbol content to any external document or web page)
- Context-dependent text auto-completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Undo/Redo, Copy-Paste
- (Limited) VIM mode - You can use :wq or :%s,search,replace,g, and /search pattern
- Python API to parse and render SDL from other Python modules
- Simulator (prototype)

Main limitations
-----------

- Supports only one process at a time (use [TASTE](https://taste.tools) to connect processes to form a complete system)
- Minimal support of legacy SDL datatypes (newtypes/synonyms..): use ASN.1 instead

Installation
============

OpenGEODE is made primarily for Linux.

It is part of the [TASTE project](https://taste.tools)

It is installed with all dependencies in the TASTE virtual machine that you can download from [this link](https://taste.tools/#install). Manual installation is possible in a native Linux environment.
Debian 10 (buster) is the baseline. Recent versions of Ubuntu (20.x) should work as well.

Using TASTE
-----------

__Important: OpenGEODE is already installed in the TASTE10 Virtual Machine (based on Debian Buster), and fully integrated with the toolset. It is the easiest way to get started with OpenGEODE__

To start a new project run:
```
$ taste
```

Select a project name and the graphical editor will pop-up shortly after. You can add functions to the system and specify the implementation language to __SDL__. When you edit the function, the OpenGEODE editor will start.

You can check an example of a system using Opengeode if you go in `~/tool-src/kazoo/tests/Demo_ABB_Opengeode` and run `make` to build it. Then `taste` to edit.

The code is automatically generated when you exit the tool.

Manual
------

The following commands should automate the installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/esa/opengeode
$ cd opengeode
$ make full-install   # it will prompt for sudo password to call apt
```

The installation will be done in the `~/.local` folder by the Python3 pip tool. Make sure you add this to your .bashrc (or equivalent):

```
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Once you have the dependencies installed you can update the tool by running the following commands:

```
$ git pull
$ make install    # alternatively:  pip3 install --user --upgrade opengeode
```

      variable-length arrays. the latter can no longer be indexed on the

      The proper ways to set values of a variable-length array are:
      1) ASN.1 value notation var := { a, b, c }
      2) New assignment to replace a value using append statements:
         var := var (0) // { b } // var (2, 3)

**2.0.19 (01/2019)**
- for CHOICE types variables can be declared with enumerated type
      corresponding to the choice discriminant. CHOICE type is suffixed by
      "-selection", and the "present" operator now returns type type
